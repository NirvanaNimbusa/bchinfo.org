Today we are excited to announce btcinformation.org, a website where you can
learn about Bitcoin. This website is a community maintained fork of Bitcoin.org<!-- skip-test -->.

While Bitcoin.org<!-- skip-test --> is still a great resource, we feel that recent events are
damaging Bitcoin.org<!-- skip-test -->'s neutrality. Furthermore, the maintainers and domain owners have, over the past few years,
been taking unilateral actions which go against the wishes of and occurred without
the consent of the community. These actions have been driving away frequent
contributors to the project.

As a result of these, we have decided to launch btcinformation.org as a community
maintained fork of Bitcoin.org<!-- skip-test -->. The goal of this site is to be a neutral,
informational resource about Bitcoin and how to use Bitcoin.

This website, like Bitcoin.org<!-- skip-test -->, is fully open source. If you would like to contribute
or view the source code, please visit https://github.com/achow101/btcinformation.org.

## Differences From Bitcoin.org<!-- skip-test -->

While browsing btcinformation.org, you may nave noticed that the site is slightly
different from Bitcoin.org<!-- skip-test -->. Below are the changes that were made:

* Reverted the redesign. In order to keep btcinformation.org visually distinct
from Bitcoin.org<!-- skip-test -->, we have reverted the site redesign so that the website has
a different look and feel to it.
* Removed Events. The events page on Bitcoin.org<!-- skip-test --> was frequently populated with
non-bitcoin related events. This page is additionally hard to maintain with
new events, so it has been removed.
* Removed Bitcoin Cash Node sub-site. Bitcoin Cash Node is a project independent of
Bitcoin.org<!-- skip-test --> and btcinformation.org. Thus pages dedicated solely to Bitcoin Cash Node
have been removed.
* Disabled translations. While we are working on the site, we have temporarily
disabled translations. They will be re-enabled at some time in the future.
* Less use of JavaScript and Cookies. We have removed the Google Analytics
trackers that are on Bitcoin.org<!-- skip-test -->. While this information is useful, we do
not think that it is useful for btcinformation.org as we never intend to sell
ads. With this removal, as much JavaScript was removed as possible.
* Removed donations. For now, we are not accepting donations as we work on a
better, distributed donations setup.
